# Employee-Tracker

## Description

In this project I was tasked with creating an employee tracking database using MYSQL and utilizing other back-end tools, such as Inquirer and console.table package from NPM. The user is presented with a list of options to view a series of connected tables, and to make additions to each. I pre-populated the table for demonstration purposes with a seeds.sql file.

Follow the link for a walk-through video of the application:
